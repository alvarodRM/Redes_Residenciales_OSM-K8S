# The ddns-updates-style parameter controls whether or not the server will

# behavior of the version 2 packages ('none', since DHCP v2 didn't
# have support for DDNS.)

# DHCP server to understand the network topology.

#subnet 10.152.187.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {

# This is a very basic subnet declaration.

#  range 10.254.239.10 10.254.239.20;

# This declaration allows BOOTP clients to get dynamic addresses,
# which we don't really recommend.
